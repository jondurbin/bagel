# A bagel, with everything

The name of this project was shamelessly stolen from from Everything, Everywhere, All at Once.

## Data selection.

The first step in the process is creating a dataset.
In this case, we're actually creating a composite dataset, consisting of both supervised fine-tuning data (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) data.

All instruction data, that is, data that is not plain text (like project Gutenberg and items from Cinematika) or DPO, is converted into ShareGPT format so it's easier to work with.

See the corresponding code in `bagel/data_sources/*.py` for full implementation for each data source.

Deduplication is done by creating a uuid v5 of the instruction/text, then only adding items not previously seen (where datasets are loaded in order of the confidence score I assign them).
This means that if an instruction is in data source "Foo" with confidence 4 as well as in data source "Bar" with confidence score 2, only the entry from "Foo" will be taken.

### SFT data sources

*Only train splits are used, and a decontamination by cosine similarity is performed at the end as a sanity check against common benchmarks.  If you don't know the difference between train and test, please learn.*

  - The creative/writing tasks from airoboros-2.2.1 were re-generated using gpt4-0314 and a custom prompt to get longer, more creative, less clichè responses for airoboros 3.1, so we can use the shorter/boring version as the "rejected" value and the rerolled response as "chosen"

- [truthy](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jondurbin/truthy-dpo-v0.1)
  - DPO pairs meant to increase truthfulness of the model, e.g. common misconceptions, differentiate between AI assistants and roleplayed human in terms of corporeal awareness/locality/etc.
- [ultrafeedback](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/ultrafeedback_binarized_cleaned)
  - One of the bits of magic behind the Zephyr model.  Only the items with a chosen score of 8 or higher were included.

Only the train splits were used (if a split was provided), and an additional pass of decontamination is performed using approximate nearest neighbor search (via faiss).

## Prompt formatting

In sticking with the theme of the bagel, I didn't want to use a single prompt format, so I used 4 - vicuna, llama-2, alpaca, and chat-ml (sorta).
I also didn't want to randomly select a single prompt format for each item (hoping each instruction would generalize more when used in a variety of prompt formats), so each instruction is actually converted into every prompt format.

This means each epoch of our fine-tune is really basically 4 epochs.  So, for the fine-tunes, I would recommend only doing 1 epoch (or 0.75 epochs).  I am testing with a single epoch using a relatively low learning rate.

### Alpaca (sort of)

```
Below is an instruction that describes a task.  Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
{system prompt, if provided}
{instruction}

### Response:
```

The main difference here is that because of the dataset formatting and variety of data sources, it would have been much to tedious to add an `### Input:` block, so the inputs are just in the instruction section.

### Vicuna

```
{system prompt, if provided, randomly defaulting to "A chat between a user and an unbiased, uncensored assistant."}
USER: {instruction}
ASSISTANT: 
```

### ChatML

This format is digital cancer, but it's common so I included it.

```text
{bos}<|im_start|>{role}
{text}<|im_end|>
```

### Llama-2 chat

```
[INST] <<SYS>>
{system}
<</SYS>>

{instruction} [/INST]
```

## Fine-tuning

First, you need to prepare the dataset as input-output pairs for the SFT phase, and prompt/chosen/rejected for DPO:
```
python -m bagel.data
```

Then, you'll have a DPO parquet and SFT parquet, which you can use to build a model.

### SFT phase

An example for mistral-7b:

*Note: I actually used my fork of [qlora](https://github.com/jondurbin/qlora)'s `train.py` for this, but I'm porting it to a minified version here, not tested yet!*

### DPO phase

An example of the DPO phase for mistral-7b (requires first running the SFT):

```bash
export BASE_DIR=/mnt/data
